    dependencies are services or objects that a class needs to perform its function. Dependency injection, or DI, is a design pattern in which a class requests dependencies from external sources rather than creating them.

Angular's DI framework provides dependencies to a class upon instantiation. You can use Angular DI to increase flexibility and modularity in your applications.
The @Injectable() decorator specifies that Angular can use this class in the DI system. The metadata, providedIn: 'root', means that the DisplayService is visible throughout the application.

<h3>Injecting services </h3>
<p>To inject a dependency in a component's constructor(), supply a constructor argument with the dependency type. The following example specifies DisplayService in the DetailComponent constructor.
